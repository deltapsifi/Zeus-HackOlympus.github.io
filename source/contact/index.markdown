Hello everyone, Zeus this side. This blog is created by me and my friend delta-psi-phi (Check out his [science blog](https://deltapsifi.github.io/) ). I am a high school student and I aim to learn everything related to computers. This blog contains all the information that I have gathered in my journey(well not all, but I promiseðŸ˜‰ Iâ€™ll be adding more soon).

I do self study and everything that I have learned till date is from internet resources. During self study, most of my time was wasted in finding the right resource, so for my peers I have made it easy to learn, I have given links from where I learned things so that you all can learn without any obstruction. 

Enjoy learning new things. All the best !!

Sometimes I get very late adding new articles but donâ€™t worry I am always working on something to present in front of you guys.
